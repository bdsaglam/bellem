       "   'context': '# Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers\\nTom Petty and the Heartbreakers (alternately Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers) were an American rock band from Gainesville, Florida. Formed in 1976, the band originally comprised Tom Petty (lead singer, guitar), Mike Campbell (lead guitarist), Ron Blair (bass guitar), Stan Lynch (drums), and Benmont Tench (keyboards). In 1981, Blair, weary of the touring lifestyle, departed the band. His replacement, Howie Epstein, stayed with the band for the next two decades. In 1991, Scott Thurston joined the band as a multi-instrumentalist—mostly on rhythm guitar and second keyboards. Blair returned to the Heartbreakers in 2002, the year before Epstein\\'s death. In 1994, Steve Ferrone replaced Lynch on drums. The band is best known for the hit singles \"American Girl\", \"Breakdown\", \"The Waiting\", \"Learning to Fly\", \"Refugee\" and \"Mary Jane\\'s Last Dance\".\\n# List of King of the Hill characters\\nElroy ``Lucky \\'\\'Kleinschmidt (voiced by Tom Petty) -- Lucky is Luanne\\'s itinerant, but generally benign redneck husband, and is the father of Luanne\\'s child. It is often hard for Lucky to hold down a job (he has no credit or Social Security number). He lives on the remainder of the $53,000`` settlement monies\\'\\' he received after ``slipping on pee - pee at the Costco \\'\\'having had a portion of his spine fused. He was nicknamed`` Lucky\\'\\' after the settlement windfall. After he spent a majority of his money customizing his truck, his finances dwindled down to nine thousand dollars but regained another $53,000 when an ambulance chasing lawyer paid off Lucky to avoid a lawsuit. Peggy tried very hard to break him and Luanne apart, but after Luanne\\'s pregnancy was revealed, she and Hank reconciled the two, giving them a shotgun wedding at Lucky\\'s request. He is also one of the guitarists for John Redcorn\\'s band ``Big Mountain Fudgecake \\'\\'. Although dimwitted in some aspects, Lucky has learned some facets such as basic math through life experience as opposed to formal education, and was astute enough to deduce that his father - in - law spent time in jail whereas Luanne believed the story that he works on an oil rig. He yearned to receive his GED but only to prove he was good enough to marry Luanne.',\n",

       "  'context': '# Coningsby Disraeli\\nBorn in Kensington, London, Disraeli was the son of Ralph Disraeli (1809–1898, the younger son of the writer Isaac D\\'Israeli). He was educated at Charterhouse School and New College, Oxford. The Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli was his uncle. He inherited the Hughenden Manor estate acquired by his uncle on his father\\'s death in 1898.\\n# Queen Victoria\\nPalmerston died in 1865, and after a brief ministry led by Russell, Derby returned to power. In 1866, Victoria attended the State Opening of Parliament for the first time since Albert\\'s death. The following year she supported the passing of the Reform Act 1867 which doubled the electorate by extending the franchise to many urban working men, though she was not in favour of votes for women. Derby resigned in 1868, to be replaced by Benjamin Disraeli, who charmed Victoria. \"Everyone likes flattery,\" he said, \"and when you come to royalty you should lay it on with a trowel.\" With the phrase \"we authors, Ma\\'am\", he complimented her. Disraeli\\'s ministry only lasted a matter of months, and at the end of the year his Liberal rival, William Ewart Gladstone, was appointed prime minister. Victoria found Gladstone\\'s demeanour far less appealing; he spoke to her, she is thought to have complained, as though she were \"a public meeting rather than a woman\".',\n",
