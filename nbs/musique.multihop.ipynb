      "Reasoning: [{'question': 'In what war did Jameel Sayhood fight in?', 'query': 'In what war did Jameel Sayhood fight in?', 'context': '# Muslim Atayev\\nMuslim Atayev (June 24, 1973 – January 27, 2005), also known as Emir Sayfullah, was the founder of the militant organization Yarmuk Jamaat, which later became part of the Caucasus Front\\'s Kabardino-Balkarian Sector in the Russian-held Caucasian Muslim state Kabardino-Balkaria of the Second Chechen War. Atayev was an ethnic Balkar and started his military career as a volunteer fighting in Chechnya.\\n# Warsaw Pact\\nFor 36 years, NATO and the Warsaw Pact never directly waged war against each other in Europe; the United States and the Soviet Union and their respective allies implemented strategic policies aimed at the containment of each other in Europe, while working and fighting for influence within the wider Cold War on the international stage.\\n# Jean de Clermont\\nJean de Clermont (d. 19 September 1356), Lord of Chantilly and of Beaumont, was a Marshal of France (1352) who was killed fighting in the Hundred Years\\' War at the Battle of Poitiers.\\n# Morgan McCammon\\nBorn in Montreal, Quebec, he started studying at McGill University in 1940. He did not complete his education but rather joined the Canadian Army, fighting during World War II with the Princess Patricia\\'s Canadian Light Infantry. After the war, he continued his education receiving a law degree in 1949. He worked four years as a lawyer with the law firm of Brais-Campbell before joining Steinberg\\'s real-estate business in 1953. He joined Molson Breweries in 1958 eventually becoming President and Chairman.\\n# Boxing After Dark\\nBoxing After Dark is an HBO boxing program, premiering on February 3, 1996, that usually showed fights between well-known contenders, but usually not \"championship\" or \"title\" fights. Unlike its sister program, \"HBO World Championship Boxing\", \"BAD\" featured fighters who were usually moving up from ESPN\\'s \"Friday Night Fights\" or another basic cable boxing program. This was where fighters were given their start to become famous depending on how well they fare on \"BAD\" they might have a title fight on \"World Championship Boxing\" or could fall back (Ex: Jason Litzau had many entertaining fights on ESPN before moving up to \"BAD\" to face Jose Hernandez. After Litzau lost by knockout he returned to \"FNF\")\\n# Constantin Brătescu\\nConstantin Brătescu (March 8, 1892 – April 13, 1971) was a Romanian Major-General during World War II. In 1941, he served first as Chief Propaganda Section General Staff (Romania\\'s Propaganda Minister) and then as a Romanian liaison officer to the German Military Mission, meaning that he served as a German military officer during Operation Barbarossa and the Axis Invasion of the Soviet Union. Starting in 1942 Brătescu was a Romanian General Officer (at the rank of Major-General) and commanded the 1st Cavalry Division throughout the campaign against the Soviets, fighting in such engagements as Operation Barbarossa, Operation Blue, and the Battle of Stalingrad. Following the surrender of Friedrich Paulus\\' 6th Army at the Battle of Stalingrad, Brătescu became a prisoner of war and was held captive from 1943 to 1948. Finally, in 1948, he was released after five years of imprisonment and subsequently retired from active service. Bratescu ultimately died twenty-three years later, in 1971, at the age of seventy-nine.\\n# Esther Duflo\\nEsther Duflo, FBA (; born 25 October 1972) is a French American economist, Co-Founder and Director of the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL), and Professor of Poverty Alleviation and Development Economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Duflo is an NBER Research Associate, serves on the board of the Bureau for Research and Economic Analysis of Development (BREAD), and is Director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research\\'s development economics program.\\n# Blue Star Memorial Highway\\nBlue Star Memorial Highways are highways in the United States that are marked to pay tribute to the U.S. armed forces. The National Council of State Garden Clubs, now known as National Garden Clubs, Inc., started the program in 1945 after World War II. The blue star was used on service flags to denote a service member fighting in the war. The program has since been expanded to include Memorial Markers and Memorial By-ways (since 1994). These markers are used in National Cemeteries, parks, veterans facilities, and gardens.\\n# Kamakura Gongorō Kagemasa\\nKamakura Gongorō Kagemasa (鎌倉権五郎景政) (born 1069) was a samurai descended from the Taira clan, who fought for the Minamoto clan in the Gosannen War of Japan\\'s Heian period. He is famous for having continued to fight after losing an eye in battle during that war. This was in 1085, when Kagemasa was sixteen years of age.\\n# Gulf War\\nThe Gulf War (2 August 199028 February 1991), codenamed Operation Desert Shield (2 August 199017 January 1991) for operations leading to the buildup of troops and defense of Saudi Arabia and Operation Desert Storm (17 January 199128 February 1991) in its combat phase, was a war waged by coalition forces from 35 nations led by the United States against Iraq in response to Iraq\\'s invasion and annexation of Kuwait arising from oil pricing and production disputes. The war is also known under other names, such as the Persian Gulf War, First Gulf War, Gulf War I, Kuwait War, First Iraq War or Iraq War, before the term \"Iraq War\" became identified instead with the post-2003 Iraq War.\\n# Samuel Hearne\\nSamuel Hearne was born in February 1745 in London UK.
